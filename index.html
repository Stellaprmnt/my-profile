			<h2 class="title-fontsize">Music 🎺</h2>
			<p> Ever since I was young, I have been in love with music. The beauty and the magic of it can completely change our moods and emotions. I have followed music classes from elementary school to this day. There, I learned a lot about the history of music, on how to play as a part of an Orchestra, singing and dancing along with how to play Flûte traversière and piano. 🎹 It was an amazing thing to start as a child and a wonderful experience.
			It allowed me to realize that I still wanted to work with music in my life.

			<h2 class="title-fontsize">Marketing and Communication 📱</h2>
			<p>After trying and learning International Business, I realized that what I loved was Marketing and Communication. I developped my competences through 4 years of apprenticeship at a Communication Agency as a Project Manager, working for different brands. I recently launched my own Communication Agency together with 4 of my old colleagues called <a href="https://www.zelda.fr/"  target="_blank">Zelda</a>, why don't you go ahead and check our website ?

			<h2 class="title-fontsize">Code - Frontend dev 💻</h2>
			<p>Being in touch with UI/UX designer and web developper during my apprenticeship, I developped an interest for frontend development (coding) and started learning by myself before having classes about it through the platform <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/"  target="_blank">Le Wagon</a>.</p>
